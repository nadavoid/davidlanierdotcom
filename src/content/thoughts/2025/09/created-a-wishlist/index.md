# I created a wishlist

Some people like to give me things. Weird. Well here are some things I want. (link)

And some thoughts about arriving at this particular wishlist...
- Former site had it built in.
- For this site, I wanted to look for an external service first. All the features I had before, and more, and better done, and I didn't have to make it, and it's free.
- Sites I considered briefly.
- Site I ultimately chose, because it looked the cleanest, and didn't overhype things.
