# I created a wishlist

Some people like to give me things. Weird. Well here are some things that would be nice to receive. https://www.thingstogetme.com/david-lanier

On my previous site, I made my own little wishlist feature. It was literally just a list, grouped by category. On this iteration of my personal site, I'm aiming to outsource more, using third party services. The idea is that they'll do it better, and they'll take on keeping the underlying tech updated.

That's how I arrived at this particular wishlist service. Some sites I considered briefly include https://giftful.com, https://www.wishlist.com, https://giftlist.com, and https://www.giftster.com.

The site I ultimately chose, because it looked the cleanest, and didn't overhype things, is https://www.thingstogetme.com. Check it out if you need to share a wishlist with other people.
