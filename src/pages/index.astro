		<h1>David Lanier's Site</h1>
		<p>Hello! Glad you're here.</p>
		<p>I'll be using this space to share <a href="/thoughts">my thoughts</a> and experiments on a diverse range of topics.</p>
		<p>This is a very plain place right now, but I'll be adding to it over time.</p>
		<p>If you would like to be notified when I have more content or features added, please just send me an email: david at davidlanier dot com.</p>
		<p>Some of the thoughts I'll share will be much shorter than what I've done in the past.</p>
		<p>The main next features will be a contact form, an RSS feed, and a email list (just an email version of the RSS feed)</p>
		<p>Topics will include technology (web and other), music (creation and enjoyment), crafts (weaving, spinning yarn), tarot (and deep thoughts), and general life stuff (like my cat, home repair, and nature photos).</p>
		<p>Thanks for visiting, and I'll see you soon!</p>
