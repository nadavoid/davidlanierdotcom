# 🧠 Personal Website Project Plan (Astro-Based)

## 🏁 Goals
- Minimal-maintenance personal site, with a community feel
- Blog with RSS feeds per topic, including combined topics
- Email subscriptions (immediate + weekly)
- Topic-based content structure (e.g., Tech, Music, Tarot, Life)
- Showcase of web development skills
- Custom branding and style; no ads or heavy subscription nags
- Eventually include commenting and voice messaging features
- Accessibility is a key priority; use semantic HTML and accessible components

---

## ❓ Decisions To Make

### Need to Know Before Starting to Build

- [x] Which Astro starter/template to use: **Minimal custom setup, start with minimal styling and a little Bootstrap for CSS. Add styling/layouts gradually.**
- [x] Initial controlled topic list: **Technology, Music, Tarot, Craft, Life**

### Decisions for Later

- Email provider: Buttondown or ConvertKit
- Commenting system: Commento, Giscus, or custom
- Hosting provider: Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages
- When to add analytics and which provider to choose
